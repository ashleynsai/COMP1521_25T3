# Two's Complement

Two's complement is just another way of interpreting bits now that we want to represent negative numbers.

The leading bit in two's complement denotes the sign.



## Converting between negative and positive in two's complement

Flip every bit, then add 1

```
Convert the following into its opposite sign 8-bit two's complement binary notation:
		1. 5 in binary is: 0b 0000 0101       therefore -5 in binary is:   0b 1111 1011
		2. 29 in binary is: 0b 0001 1101      therefore -29 in binary is:  0b 1110 0011
		4. -100 in binary is: 0b 1001 1100    therefore 100 in binary is:  0b 0110 0100
```



### Tutorial Q1

Assume that the following hexadecimal values are 16-bit twos-complement. Convert each to the corresponding decimal value.

i. 0x0013

ii. 0x0444

iii. 0x1234

iv. 0xFFFF

v. 0x8000



### Tutorial Q2

Give a representation for each of the following decimal values in 16-bit twos-complement bit-strings. Show the value in binary, octal and hexadecimal.

1. 1 in binary is: 
2. 100 in binary is: 
3. -5 in binary is: 
4. -100 in binary is: 



### Tutorial Q3 (code)

On a machine with 16-bit `int`s, the C expression `(30000 + 30000)` yields a negative result.

Why the negative result? How can you make it produce the correct result?
